# Project_Weeeb

This project is planned as _out_of_the_box_ solution for implementing visual novels in Unity.
It will always be distributed under MIT licence, free to use both for commercial and personal projects.

Planned features defining this visual novel engine:
1. Simple creation of complex and intertwined stories. Get away from the tree-like structure of other engines and use tag's system. Less convinient for small-scale novels,
vastly more convinient for complex storeis with open-world-like progression.
2. Add-ons for extending game behaviour. Possible addition of game map/minigames/inventoey system/etc.
3. Simple integration of ADS/IAP with minimal requiered code skills
4. Two types of documentation. One classical with information for developers and one with oversimplified instructions for simple folks.
5. Add-ons for UI styles and presets.

Questionable features for later development:
1. Linking system to keep progress between instances, possibly implemented with facebook link.
2. Photon multiplayer system, possible usage: reading novels together (extremly questionable)
3. Randomize system for creating rogue-like-like experience (even more questionable)
